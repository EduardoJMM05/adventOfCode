# adventOfCode

Throughout this repository you will find my own solutions for [Advent Of Code](https://adventofcode.com/).

## Motivation

The purpose of this repository is to improve my programming logic and also to get a better approach on how to use this logic in JavaScript.

## Installation

To run this code we need to have npm and node installed.

To install them we can consult the [official npm documentation](https://docs.npmjs.com/downloading-and-installing-node-js-and-npm).

## Run

To run the project, for example to run day 1 of 2015

```bash
  npm run YEAR:DAY
```

You have to replace those values by the values of the year and the day you want to run.

For exaple if you want to run the day 1 of 2015, the script you have to run must be the follow:

```bash
	npm run 2015:1
```

Inside each folder you will find the input file given to me by the platform, if you want to try your own input file you have to change the content or replace the path with your own file.
